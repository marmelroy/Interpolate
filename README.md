# Interpolate
Interpolate is a powerful Swift interpolation framework for creating interactive gesture-driven animations.

## Usage

The :key: idea  of Interpolate is -
**all animation is the interpolation of values over time.**    

To use Interpolate:

Import Interpolate at the top of your Swift file.

```swift
import Interpolate
```

Create an Interpolate object with a from value, a to value and an apply closure that applies the interpolation's result to the target object.

```swift
let colorChange = Interpolate(from: UIColor.white,
to: UIColor.red,
apply: { [weak self] (color) in
    self?.view.backgroundColor = color
})
```

Alternatively, you can specify multiple values for the interpolation in an array. The Swift compiler might have issues to infer the type of the array so it's best to be explicit.
```swift
let colors: [UIColor] = [UIColor.white, UIColor.red, UIColor.green]
let colorChange = Interpolate(values: colors,
apply: { [weak self] (color) in
    self?.view.backgroundColor = color
})
```

Next, you will need to define a way to translate your chosen gesture's progress to a percentage value (i.e. a CGFloat between 0.0 and 1.0).

For a gesture recognizer or delegate that reports every step of its progress (e.g. UIPanGestureRecognizer or a ScrollViewDidScroll) you can just apply the percentage directly to the Interpolate object:
```swift
@IBAction func handlePan(recognizer: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
    let translation = recognizer.translation(in: self.view)
    let translatedCenterY = view.center.y + translation.y
    let progress = translatedCenterY / self.view.bounds.size.height
    colorChange.progress = progress
}
```

For other types of gesture recognizers that only report a beginning and an end (e.g. a UILongPressGestureRecognizer), you can animate directly to a target progress value with a given duration. For example:
```swift
@IBAction func handleLongPress(recognizer: UILongPressGestureRecognizer) {
    switch recognizer.state {
        case .began:
            colorChange.animate(1.0, duration: 0.3)
        case .cancelled, .ended, .failed:
            colorChange.animate(0.0, duration: 0.3)
        default: break
    }
}
```
You can also set a custom progress calculation closure if you need, returning a tuple with a new percent value AND a boolean indicating if the animation should stop :
```swift
let startDate = Date()
let endDate = startDate.addingTimeInterval(10)

let diff = endDate.timeIntervalSince(startDate)

let percentClosure: ProgressClosure = { (_) -> (CGFloat, Bool) in
let now = Date().timeIntervalSince(startDate)
let _percent = CGFloat((diff - now) / diff)
let percent = 1 - max(0, min(_percent, 1))
// return new percent and indicate if the animation should stop
return (newPercent: percent, shouldStop: percent == 1)
}

let colorChange = Interpolate(from: UIColor.red,
to: UIColor.black,
percentClosure: percentClosure) { [weak self] (color) in
self?.view.backgroundColor = color
}

colorChange.animate {
print("completed")
}
```

To stop an animation:
```swift
colorChange.stopAnimation()
```

When you are done with the interpolation altogether:
```swift
colorChange.invalidate()
```

Voila!

## What can I interpolate?

Interpolate currently supports the interpolation of:
- CGPoint
- CGRect
- CGSize
- Double
- CGFloat
- Int
- NSNumber
- UIColor
- CGAffineTransform
- CATransform3D
- UIEdgeInsets

More types will be added over time.

## Advanced usage

Interpolate is not just for dull linear interpolations.

For smoother animations, consider using any of the following functions: **easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut and Spring.**

```swift
// Spring interpolation
let shadowPosition = Interpolate(from: -shadowView.frame.size.width,
to: (self.view.bounds.size.width - shadowView.frame.size.width)/2,
function: SpringInterpolation(damping: 30.0, velocity: 0.0, mass: 1.0, stiffness: 100.0),
apply: { [weak self] (originX) in
    self?.shadowView.frame.origin.x = originX
})

// Ease out interpolation
let groundPosition = Interpolate(from: CGPoint(x: 0, y: self.view.bounds.size.height),
to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: self.view.bounds.size.height - 150),
function: BasicInterpolation.easeOut,
apply: { [weak self] (origin) in
    self?.groundView.frame.origin = origin
})
```

In fact, you can easily create and use your own interpolation function - all you need is an object that conforms to the InterpolationFunction protocol.

### Setting up with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=Interpolate)
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
pod 'Interpolate', '~> 1.0.0'
```

### Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Interpolate into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "marmelroy/Interpolate"
```
